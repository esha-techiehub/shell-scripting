# üêö What is Shell Scripting?

A **Shell Script** is a **text file containing a series of commands** that you write to be executed by the **Shell** (such as Bash, Zsh, or Sh).

Instead of typing commands one by one manually in the terminal, you can **automate** those tasks by writing them into a **script file** and letting the shell run it line by line.

---

## üí° In Simple Terms

- The **Shell** = interpreter (like Bash or Zsh).  
- The **Script** = list of commands you want the Shell to run automatically.  
- Together ‚Üí **Shell Scripting** = automation using command sequences.

Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello, Welcome to Linux Automation!"
mkdir /home/student/scripts_backup
cp *.sh /home/student/scripts_backup/
echo "All scripts backed up successfully!"
```

Here:
- `#!/bin/bash` tells the system which shell to use (shebang line).  
- The commands are executed in order ‚Äî just like you typed them manually.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Purpose of Shell Scripting

| Purpose | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Automation** | Replaces manual tasks with scripts (e.g., backups, log cleaning). |
| **Configuration Management** | Automatically sets up environment variables, user permissions, etc. |
| **Server Administration** | Start/stop services, monitor system performance, manage users. |
| **Continuous Integration (CI/CD)** | Automate build, test, and deployment pipelines. |
| **Monitoring and Alerts** | Check CPU usage, disk space, and send alerts if thresholds are crossed. |
| **System Boot Tasks** | Run initialization scripts during startup or shutdown. |

## üß± Structure of a Shell Script

| Part | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Shebang Line** | Tells OS which shell to use | `#!/bin/bash` |
| **Comments** | Explain what each step does | `# This script backs up logs` |
| **Commands** | Tasks to execute | `cp`, `mv`, `echo`, etc. |
| **Variables** | Store values dynamically | `USER_NAME="eshwari"` |
| **Control Flow** | Logic to make decisions | `if`, `for`, `while`, etc. |
| **Functions** | Reusable code blocks | `backup_files()` |

## üß∞ Real-Time Example: Backup Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Backup Script for DevOps Server

BACKUP_SRC="/var/www/html"
BACKUP_DEST="/backup/$(date +%F)"
mkdir -p $BACKUP_DEST

cp -r $BACKUP_SRC $BACKUP_DEST

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Backup Successful on $(date)"
else
    echo "Backup Failed!"
fi
```

‚úÖ **What it does:**
- Creates a dated backup folder.  
- Copies website files to the backup location.  
- Checks exit status (`$?`) to verify success.

## üåü Importance of Shell Scripting

| Area | Why It‚Äôs Important |
|------|--------------------|
| **System Administration** | Helps automate routine admin tasks like backups, updates, and monitoring. |
| **DevOps & CI/CD** | Used in Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps pipelines for automation. |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | Automate provisioning of servers, configuring users, and security settings. |
| **Data Processing** | Combine Linux commands (grep, awk, sed) to process large log files. |
| **Testing & Validation** | Automate repetitive test cases and output comparison. |
| **Startup Tasks** | Used in `/etc/init.d/` or `systemd` scripts to launch services automatically. |

## üöÄ Benefits of Shell Scripting

| Benefit | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Time Saving** | Executes multiple commands automatically instead of manual entry. |
| **Error Reduction** | Eliminates human error by standardizing tasks. |
| **Automation** | Greatly improves efficiency ‚Äî ‚ÄúWrite Once, Run Anytime.‚Äù |
| **Portability** | Works across Linux distributions (Bash, Sh). |
| **Integration** | Easily integrates with DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and Ansible. |
| **Logging & Reporting** | Automatically logs actions and results for audits. |
| **Customization** | You can modify the script easily for different use cases. |
| **Resource Efficiency** | Runs directly in OS environment ‚Äî no need for external compilers. |

## üß© When to Use Shell Scripting

- When repetitive manual tasks need automation.
- When configuring Linux servers or cloud environments.
- For scheduled jobs via `cron`.
- During CI/CD pipeline steps.
- When debugging or parsing log files.
- To manage large numbers of files or processes.

## ‚ö° Example: Automate Server Health Check

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Server Health Monitoring Script

echo "Server Health Check - $(date)"
echo "--------------------------------"
echo "CPU Usage:"
top -bn1 | grep "Cpu(s)"
echo "Memory Usage:"
free -h
echo "Disk Space:"
df -h
```

‚úÖ Use this to send periodic system reports to admins or developers.
